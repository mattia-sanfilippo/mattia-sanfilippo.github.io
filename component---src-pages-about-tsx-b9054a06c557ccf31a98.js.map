I highly recommend subscribing to these e-learning platforms, especially the first two if you want to improve your skills and excel in development and soft skills.<br />\n\n                  Subsequently, after getting involved again, I wanted to take the opportunity to join the Oval team, a platform that allows you to accumulate and invest your money with caution.<br />\n                  The project interested me very much and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get started!<br />\n\n                  There I really learned a lot, from mastering React Native to perfecting skills in JavaScript, TypeScript and functional programming in general.<br />\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  After almost a year, I was offered to join a team at H-FARM, a very large company with an unrivaled campus of innovation and culture.<br />\n                  I currently work here at H-FARM and continue to develop in JavaScript, particularly in the Frontend and mobile area with React Native.<br />\n                  How will my story continue? I&rsquo;ll find out just by trying to improve myself and my skills, experimenting and learning from mistakes day by day.<br />\n\n                  Thanks for coming to read this far. I hope I haven&rsquo;t annoyed you too much and have given you enough information about my career.<br />\n\n                  See you soon!<br />\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </PostFullContent>\n          </article>\n        </div>\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </Wrapper>\n  </IndexLayout>\n);\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
